## University projects
Here are some of the projects I completed during university courses.

### Minesweeper
This project was part of our first programming course. The goal was to learn the basics of Python programming, so the project was developed in Finnish.

The program allows the user to define the width and height of the playing field and the number of mines. It then launches a window where the player can enjoy a traditional Minesweeper game. After the game ends, the results are saved to a file named "pelitiedosto.txt".

This was a really fun project, and I learned a lot about programming fundamentals during this course.

### Server project
In this project, we built an HTTPS server where users can store information about attractions worldwide. The server supports user registration, processes JSON-formatted messages, and uses a database to store the information.

Additionally, I implemented a weather service (provided in the course material) and added a feature allowing users to create sightseeing tours with custom tour messages.

This project was challenging, especially when working on the HTTPS server. Some parts felt complicated initially, but with some help and practice, it became more manageable. Completing this project and seeing everything work was incredibly rewarding.

### Fibonacci checker
The task for this project was to determine whether a given string represents a Fibonacci sequence. We coded this in Y86 Assembly language, which was quite different from the other programming languages we had learned before.

At first, it was challenging to adapt to the low-level nature of Y86 Assembly, but once I became more comfortable with the syntax and logic, the project went smoothly. This was an interesting way to dive deeper into how programming works at a lower level.
