# University-projects
Here are some of the projects I have done in university courses.

# Minesweeper
This was the first programming course we had. This was done, unfortunately, in Finnish since the main goal was to learn basics of programming in Python.
The code gives user an option to give width and length of the playing field and the number of mines. Then it opens a window where player can play the traditional minesweeper game. After the game ends, results are saved in a file "pelitiedosto.txt".
This was a really fun project to do and I learned so much about programming in this course. 

# Server project

# Fibonacci
The task of this code was to check if the given string is a Fibonacci sequence. We used y86 Assembly language to code this, which was quite different from all the other programming languages we had used prior to this course. At the start, it was a bit complicated but once I got comfortable with this language, the project went well.
